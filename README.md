# Sudoku_Java

OVERVIEW
The topic for July 15's code is: Sudoku.
  This is a 'simple' but effective Sudoku game implemented in Java using the Swing Framework. The application provides a GUI for users to play the game, which uses the basic 9x9 grid wher players can input numbers from 1 to 9. The game includes functionalities to start a new game, check the solution, and highlight matching numbers for better gameplay experience.

FEATURE/S
User Interface: The game features a clean and intuitive GUI with a 9x9 grid of text fields for user input. Each cell is designed to allow only numbers from 1 to 9, and the interface is responsive to user interactions.
Game Logic: The game generates a valid Sudoku puzzle by filling diagonal subgrids and solving the puzzle before removing a specified number of cells to create the playable game. The solution is stored and can be checked against the user's input.
Highlighting Mechanism: Users can click on any cell to highlight all instances of the same number in the grid, making it easier to identify potential placements and conflicts.

Installation
To run the JulyFifteen Sudoku game, ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. Clone or download the source code, and compile it using your preferred Java IDE or command line. Run the JulyFifteen class to launch the game.

Usage
Upon launching the application, users can start a new game by clicking the "New Game" button. They can input numbers into the cells and check their solution by clicking the "Check Solution" button. If any errors are found, the game will highlight incorrect cells and provide feedback. Users can also click on any filled cell to highlight all matching numbers in the grid.
